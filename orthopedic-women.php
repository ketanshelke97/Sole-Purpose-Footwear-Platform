            <div class="collection-description">
                <p>Orthopedic conditions involve disorders of the musculoskeletal system, particularly affecting bones,
                    joints, and muscles in the feet and lower limbs, leading to issues like plantar fasciitis, bunions,
                    and arthritis. Specialized footwear serves as a key treatment by providing features standard shoes
                    lack. These include enhanced arch support to distribute pressure, a wide toe box to accommodate
                    deformities, and superior cushioning to absorb shock and reduce joint strain. By correcting
                    alignment and offering targeted support, orthopedic footwear effectively alleviates pain, improves
                    stability, and helps restore mobility for daily activities.</p>
